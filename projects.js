Reggie Wright (Epps) is a slippery con artist who is avoiding the law, and Jackson. During a cat and mouse chase, the two stumble on a multi-million dollar diamond heist. Hiding from Jackson, Wright finds himself in the thieves' getaway van and ends up having to escape from them after they discover their booty is fake, much to the displeasure of their ruthless boss (Flanagan). When Wright meets up with his girlfriend (Mendes), he discovers that his recently purchased lottery ticket is the sole winner of $60 million. Unfortunately, his wallet, which held the ticket, was left in the thieves' van, so he persuades Jackson to help him get it back.",

Sony announced that the franchise will in turn be rebooted with new director Marc Webb and a new cast that includes Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors. The reboot's intention is to have Peter Parker back to developing his abilities in high school. It is scheduled to be released in 3D on July 3, 2012.",

Buddy's unorthodox approach to therapy is confrontational and abrasive and Dave is bewildered by it. Then, after yet another mishap, Judge Daniels orders Dave to step up his therapy or wind up in jail. So, Buddy moves in with Dave to help him battle his inner demons. Buddy himself has no inner demons since he acts out at every opportunity and that includes making lewd comments about Dave's girlfriend Linda and goading Dave into confronting every slight, past or present, head-on. But Buddy finally goes too far and Dave must decide whether to crawl back into his shell or stand up for himself. Could it be that Buddy's confounding and contradictory treatment is just what the doctor ordered?",

On a side note, it's nice to see Universal moving away from U-Control tracks, which never seem to live up to their potential. Hopefully this is a hint at the sort of PiP experiences we can expect from the studio in the future. Second Screen Experience: A second, more interactive experience is available via your tablet or PC after downloading the pocket BLU app and syncing it with your playback of the film. Alternate Ending Previsualization (HD, 8 minutes) USS Missouri VIP Tour (HD, 20 minutes): Berg, Michael Carr (President of the USS Missouri Memorial Association), and Reginald H. Johnson (USS Missouri Senior Tour Guide) take viewers on a tour of the Missouri, provide an overview of its history, and explore places on the ship most visitors aren't able to see. Preparing for Battle (HD, 11 minutes): A look at the Battleship board game with the filmmakers, the use of the game mechanics and pieces in the film, and the challenges of adapting a board game as a feature film. All Hands on Deck: The Cast (HD, 12 minutes) Engage in Battle (HD, 7 minutes): 'Shooting at Sea' and 'All Aboard the Fleet.' Commander Pete (HD, 6 minutes): Watch as director Peter Berg energizes the cast and crew. The Visual Effects (HD, 12 minutes): See how the team and Industrial Light & Magic pushes the boundaries of visual effects to bring the aliens to life."

There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.",

It will stretch from the south where heat breeds plots, lusts and intrigues; to the vast and savage eastern lands; all the way to the frozen north, where an 800-foot wall of ice protects the kingdom from the dark forces that lie beyond. Kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars, lords and honest men�all will play the �Game of Thrones.�",

        "Extra Features": "Audio Commentaries (Discs 1-5): The Blu-ray release of Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season offered seven audio commentaries. Not too shabby. Upping the supplemental ante considerably, though, The Complete Second Season offers twelve, and what a twelve they are. There's a bit of hitting and missing to be had, sure, most notably in regards to some of the actors (who occasionally drift off on small tangents), but you'd be hard pressed to find an inch of the sophomore season and its production that isn't covered. Of particular note: the overviews from the executive producing powers that be, among them George R.R. Martin, who's engaging, frank and thorough. Best of all, the commentaries are just the beginning. Tracks include 'The North Remembers' with executive producers/writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, 'The Night Lands' with actors Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) and Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy), 'What Is Dead May Never Die' with writer Bryan Cogman and director Alik Sakharov, a second stab at 'What Is Dead May Never Die' with actors Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark), 'Garden of Bones' with actors Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth), 'The Old Gods and the New' with co-executive producer/writer Vanessa Taylor and actors Kit Harington (Jon Snow) and Rose Leslie (Ygritte), 'A Man Without Honor' with Benioff and Weiss, 'The Prince of Winterfell' with actors Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), 'Blackwater' with author/co-executive producer George R.R. Martin, a second take on 'Blackwater' with director Neil Marshall and actors Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), 'Valar Morghulis' with visual effects team members Rainer Gombos and Steve Kullback, and a second 'Valar Morghulis' chat with co-executive producer/director Alan Taylor and actor Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen). In-Episode Guide (Discs 1-5, HD): Each episode features an on-screen guide interface that allows fans to learn more about the characters, lands and histories of the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. 'Characters' and 'Location' buttons deliver simple pop-up text and factoids, making each rather bland. The 'Histories' button, though, is more worthwhile, as it leads to simple but strikingly animated videos that detail the legends of Westeros and Essos as told by the characters themselves. Hear varying perspectives on key houses, religions and important events relevant to the second season. Character Profiles (Disc 1, HD, 16 minutes): Seven character bios, complete with cast and crew interviews. Profiles are available for Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Robb Stark, Joffrey Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Theron Greyjoy. Histories & Lore (Disc 5, HD): Season Two's animated 'Histories & Lore' videos (each individual character perspective/segment being approximately 2-4 minutes in length) detail everything from the 'Greyjoy Rebellion' (from the separate perspectives of Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy and Stannis Baratheon) to 'Robert's Rebellion' (Stannis, Davos Seaworth, Margaery Tyrell and Catelyn Stark), 'House Tyrell' (Margaery), 'House Greyjoy' (Theon and Yara Greyjoy), 'House Clegane' (Sandor Clegane), 'The Free Folk' (Yigrette), 'The Night's Watch' (Yigrette), 'Dragonstone' (Stannis), 'Harrenhal' (Catelyn), 'The Free Cities' (Jonah Mormont), 'Qarth' (Xaro Xhoan Daxos), 'The Drowned God' (Yara Greyjoy), 'The Alchemist Guild' (Wisdom Hallyne) and 'The Warlocks' (Xaro Xhoan Daxos). War of the Five Kings (Disc 5, HD): Track the claims, strategies and key players involved in the battle for the Iron Throne with this sprawling (almost to the point of being cumbersome) interactive guide. Exhaustive is one way of putting it. Daunting is another. For diehard fans itching to dissect every bit of lore, mythology, history, battle and military advance Game of Thrones entails. Creating the Battle of Blackwater Bay (Disc 5, HD, 31 minutes): Go behind the scenes with key members of the cast and crew in this extensive and engrossing look at developing, designing and executing the ninth episode's budget-busting Battle of Blackwater Bay. Game of Thrones Inner Circle (Disc 5, HD, 24 minutes): Actors Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Michelle Fairley and Liam Cunningham sit down with executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for an excellent roundtable discussion that manages to avoid doubling back over material already covered at length in the set's commentaries and other features to deliver plenty of fresh insights into the second season and its production. The Religions of Westeros (Disc 5, HD, 8 minutes): Martin, Benioff and Weiss discuss the competing faiths of Game of Thrones, and the manner in which religion drives and motivates the characters fighting to obtain or hold onto the Iron Throne. Hidden Dragon Eggs (Discs 1-5, HD): Find hidden dragon eggs to uncover even more content."

Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and woman never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time.

Nicholas Brody, who had been missing in action, gets a hero's welcome upon his return home following eight years in enemy captivity in Iraq, brilliant-but-volatile CIA agent Carrie Mathison doesn't buy his story.

She then engages him in a dangerous game of cat and mouse that has America's national security at stake. But Carrie's questionable investigation methods land her in hot water with Saul Berenson, her longtime mentor in the CIA, who has gone to bat for her more than once but may now be alienated by her current investigation.",

John Leguizamo is 'Mr. Wolf,' the leader of a small group of military veterans who set out to rob a major bank in Pittsburgh. When things go awry, they're forced to take more than a dozen hostages from all walks of life, including a wealthy and powerful businessman's daughter. Suddenly, 'Mr. Wolf' finds himself battling the police, the hostages and members of his own team while at the same time, fighting his own personal demons from the Iraq war and from his own war at home. Will he be sharp enough to hold it all together or lose control of the situation? And will he find redemption before it's too late -- and does he even care to? On the opposite side of the perimeter is 'Horst Cali,' the Pittsburgh Police Department Hostage Negotiator, played by Donnie Wahlberg, who must go toe-to-toe with 'Mr. Wolf.' 'Cali' must use his wit and negotiating skills, while managing his own personal issues, to manipulate the situation and convince Wolf to free the hostages before the FBI takes control, or worse. With time of the essence and the uncertainty of the unfolding events, both men need to remain resourceful and collected or risk losing lives. THE KILL POINT reveals how the hostage takers leverage their situation and how the negotiator tries to unravel their plans. Which man will blink? Who will outsmart the other? Who will survive? It's a dangerous game of chess played out with human lives at stake.",

When she arrives, she finds a security guard bleeding from a severe gunshot wound. Via surveillance cameras, she ascertains that the power plant has been infiltrated by at least four men with obviously subversive intentions. Fear of a nuclear meltdown brings F. B.I. agent Tom Shea (Bruce Greenwood) in to see if he can prevent a disaster. Scientist Syed Kahn (Manoj Sood) gets on the phone with Shea and warns him that if the intruders break into the control room, they may compromise the reactor containment. And if the containment is overpowered, then exceedingly radioactive components will be released into the surrounding environment. Kahn�s job is to make certain the reactor core is properly cooled so as not to overheat and melt. Just as Kahn is explaining the dangerous situation, three men break into the control room and point guns at the nuclear scientist and the phone line goes dead.",

Hopefully, they will only live 6-months and at most one-year. It turns out that Betty and Doris are broke, and they have come up with a plan to marry the boys, kill them, and collect the life insurance money. After several unsuccessful murder attempts on each other, they join forces to rob Betty and Doris's rich uncle",

As an added benefit, users can tap forward or backward to skip during each track to skip between segments, meaning the gaps that do find their way into the experience can be traversed with a flick of the remote. The only downside? Production details are nowhere to be found, leaving the sixth disc's 23-minute 'Making Of' documentary as the sole source of behind-the-scenes information. *Field Guide (Discs 1-5, HD): Each episode also offers an extensive 'Field Guide.' *An interactive collection of animated maps, in-depth historical information, interviews with veterans and noted WWII historians, archive footage, photographs, biographies and much, much more. If you're expecting a typical pop-up trivia track, prepare to have your expectations shattered. Every bit as essential to each episode as the Enhanced Viewing Experience, HBO's Field Guides are a remarkable supplement to a remarkable miniseries. *Profiles of The Pacific (Disc 6, HD, 49 minutes): 'A little boy asked me, he said, Mr. Tatum, are you a hero of Iwo Jima? I said, no son, I'm only a survivor. We buried all the heroes.' *Acquaint yourself with six of the real Marines -- John Basilone, Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie, Sidney Phillips, R.V. Burgin and Chuck Tatum -- whose lives are depicted in The Pacific. *Hear intimate accounts of their personalities and experiences. *Meet their surviving families and, in some cases, hear from the soldiers themselves. *Making The Pacific (Disc 6, HD, 23 minutes): A solemn look behind the scenes in which key members of the cast and crew (among them Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg) discuss the history of the war in the Pacific, the soldiers involved, the battles that were recreated, the miniseries' production, its storylines and characters, the differences between The Pacific and Band of Brothers, the performances and the challenges faced along the way by everyone involved. *Anatomy of the Pacific War (Disc 6, HD, 10 minutes): Dig into the history behind the series with this exceptional, albeit far too short dissection of the conflicts and cultures that led to the war in the Pacific."

To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes�a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)�who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.",

After having a vision of being in Hell, he decides to change his ways, but this doesn't last long. While watching television, he and Brian spot a man that looks like Stewie. Brian is convinced that he is Stewie's real father, until Stewie learns that the man is actually himself as an adult, taking a vacation from his own time period. Baby Stewie visits thirty years later to discover that his adult self, going by the name Stu, is a single blue-collar middle-aged virgin working at a Circuit City-type store. Meanwhile, Peter and Lois are trying to teach their two older kids, Meg and Chris, to date. In the future, Chris, who hasn't changed much, is working as a cop and is married to a foul-mouthed hustler named Vanessa. Meg is now called Ron, since she had a sex-change after college.

Once a total of six people have been voted out, the two tribes merge (this may vary season to season).After the merge, every person must compete for him/herself at both reward and immunity challenges. Only one person can win these challenges. Once a person receives immunity, that person can not have any votes against him/her for that tribal council. The next person to be voted out just after the merge will not return to the following tribal council. The next seven people return to be on a jury - they vote at the very last tribal council for who will win. The last Survivor at the end wins one million dollars.",

With Hot Rod facing responsibility for Prime's death, he feels he may be able to use the power of the Matrix to turn the tide of the Cybertronian Wars and stop Unicron.

The sequel revolves around Casey Ryback who hops on a Colorado to LA train to start a vacation with his niece. Early into the trip, terrorists board the train and use it as a mobile HQ to hijack a top secret destructive US satellite. While not trained how to deal with a teenager, he soon encounters a situation he is trained for.",
