Though each day's events typically revolve around thwarting an impending terrorist attack, each season is made up of various interwoven story threads. These may run for just one hour, but more usually run over several hours. These typically involve investigations of leads on terrorists, tracking suspects, and averting attacks. The exact objective of the day evolves over the course of the season as the antagonists adapt, contingencies arise, and larger scale operations unfold.","Brian Grazer; Manny Coto","12/14/2010","2010","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\24Season8201018185_b.jpg","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\24Season8201018185_d.jpg","024543690955","","0","Rodney Charters","20th Century Fox","The Complete Season 8","24",""

This presents particular challenges as the vampires' food supply - human blood - is dwindling and rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.","Sean Furst; Chris Brown","","","","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\Daybreakers200921557_d.jpg","031398122272","","0","Ben Nott","","","0",""

Not too shabby. Upping the supplemental ante considerably, though, The Complete Second Season offers twelve, and what a twelve they are. There's a bit of hitting and missing to be had, sure, most notably in regards to some of the actors (who occasionally drift off on small tangents), but you'd be hard pressed to find an inch of the sophomore season and its production that isn't covered. Of particular note: the overviews from the executive producing powers that be, among them George R.R. Martin, who's engaging, frank and thorough. Best of all, the commentaries are just the beginning. Tracks include 'The North Remembers' with executive producers/writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, 'The Night Lands' with actors Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) and Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy), 'What Is Dead May Never Die' with writer Bryan Cogman and director Alik Sakharov, a second stab at 'What Is Dead May Never Die' with actors Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark), 'Garden of Bones' with actors Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth), 'The Old Gods and the New' with co-executive producer/writer Vanessa Taylor and actors Kit Harington (Jon Snow) and Rose Leslie (Ygritte), 'A Man Without Honor' with Benioff and Weiss, 'The Prince of Winterfell' with actors Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), 'Blackwater' with author/co-executive producer George R.R. Martin, a second take on 'Blackwater' with director Neil Marshall and actors Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), 'Valar Morghulis' with visual effects team members Rainer Gombos and Steve Kullback, and a second 'Valar Morghulis' chat with co-executive producer/director Alan Taylor and actor Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen). In-Episode Guide (Discs 1-5, HD): Each episode features an on-screen guide interface that allows fans to learn more about the characters, lands and histories of the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. 'Characters' and 'Location' buttons deliver simple pop-up text and factoids, making each rather bland. The 'Histories' button, though, is more worthwhile, as it leads to simple but strikingly animated videos that detail the legends of Westeros and Essos as told by the characters themselves. Hear varying perspectives on key houses, religions and important events relevant to the second season. Character Profiles (Disc 1, HD, 16 minutes): Seven character bios, complete with cast and crew interviews. Profiles are available for Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Robb Stark, Joffrey Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Theron Greyjoy. Histories & Lore (Disc 5, HD): Season Two's animated 'Histories & Lore' videos (each individual character perspective/segment being approximately 2-4 minutes in length) detail everything from the 'Greyjoy Rebellion' (from the separate perspectives of Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy and Stannis Baratheon) to 'Robert's Rebellion' (Stannis, Davos Seaworth, Margaery Tyrell and Catelyn Stark), 'House Tyrell' (Margaery), 'House Greyjoy' (Theon and Yara Greyjoy), 'House Clegane' (Sandor Clegane), 'The Free Folk' (Yigrette), 'The Night's Watch' (Yigrette), 'Dragonstone' (Stannis), 'Harrenhal' (Catelyn), 'The Free Cities' (Jonah Mormont), 'Qarth' (Xaro Xhoan Daxos), 'The Drowned God' (Yara Greyjoy), 'The Alchemist Guild' (Wisdom Hallyne) and 'The Warlocks' (Xaro Xhoan Daxos). War of the Five Kings (Disc 5, HD): Track the claims, strategies and key players involved in the battle for the Iron Throne with this sprawling (almost to the point of being cumbersome) interactive guide. Exhaustive is one way of putting it. Daunting is another. For diehard fans itching to dissect every bit of lore, mythology, history, battle and military advance Game of Thrones entails. Creating the Battle of Blackwater Bay (Disc 5, HD, 31 minutes): Go behind the scenes with key members of the cast and crew in this extensive and engrossing look at developing, designing and executing the ninth episode's budget-busting Battle of Blackwater Bay. Game of Thrones Inner Circle (Disc 5, HD, 24 minutes): Actors Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Michelle Fairley and Liam Cunningham sit down with executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for an excellent roundtable discussion that manages to avoid doubling back over material already covered at length in the set's commentaries and other features to deliver plenty of fresh insights into the second season and its production. The Religions of Westeros (Disc 5, HD, 8 minutes): Martin, Benioff and Weiss discuss the competing faiths of Game of Thrones, and the manner in which religion drives and motivates the characters fighting to obtain or hold onto the Iron Throne. Hidden Dragon Eggs (Discs 1-5, HD): Find hidden dragon eggs to uncover even more content."

John Leguizamo is 'Mr. Wolf,' the leader of a small group of military veterans who set out to rob a major bank in Pittsburgh. When things go awry, they're forced to take more than a dozen hostages from all walks of life, including a wealthy and powerful businessman's daughter. Suddenly, 'Mr. Wolf' finds himself battling the police, the hostages and members of his own team while at the same time, fighting his own personal demons from the Iraq war and from his own war at home. Will he be sharp enough to hold it all together or lose control of the situation? And will he find redemption before it's too late -- and does he even care to? On the opposite side of the perimeter is 'Horst Cali,' the Pittsburgh Police Department Hostage Negotiator, played by Donnie Wahlberg, who must go toe-to-toe with 'Mr. Wolf.' 'Cali' must use his wit and negotiating skills, while managing his own personal issues, to manipulate the situation and convince Wolf to free the hostages before the FBI takes control, or worse. With time of the essence and the uncertainty of the unfolding events, both men need to remain resourceful and collected or risk losing lives. THE KILL POINT reveals how the hostage takers leverage their situation and how the negotiator tries to unravel their plans. Which man will blink? Who will outsmart the other? Who will survive? It's a dangerous game of chess played out with human lives at stake.","","","","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\TheKillPoint20078355_b.jpg","","031398224686","","0","","","","8",""

Windon","HBO Home Video","Blu Ray Edition Miniseries","10","*Enhanced Viewing Experience (Discs 1-5, HD): All ten episodes of The Pacific come armed with thorough, well-conceived Picture-in-Picture tracks comprised of interviews with surviving veterans (as well as family members of several deceased soldiers), analysis from a variety of historians, first-hand accounts of the conditions and wartime oddities the Marines endured, engaging pop-up factoids, brief bios and photographs. As an added benefit, users can tap forward or backward to skip during each track to skip between segments, meaning the gaps that do find their way into the experience can be traversed with a flick of the remote. The only downside? Production details are nowhere to be found, leaving the sixth disc's 23-minute 'Making Of' documentary as the sole source of behind-the-scenes information. *Field Guide (Discs 1-5, HD): Each episode also offers an extensive 'Field Guide.' *An interactive collection of animated maps, in-depth historical information, interviews with veterans and noted WWII historians, archive footage, photographs, biographies and much, much more. If you're expecting a typical pop-up trivia track, prepare to have your expectations shattered. Every bit as essential to each episode as the Enhanced Viewing Experience, HBO's Field Guides are a remarkable supplement to a remarkable miniseries. *Profiles of The Pacific (Disc 6, HD, 49 minutes): 'A little boy asked me, he said, Mr. Tatum, are you a hero of Iwo Jima? I said, no son, I'm only a survivor. We buried all the heroes.' *Acquaint yourself with six of the real Marines -- John Basilone, Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie, Sidney Phillips, R.V. Burgin and Chuck Tatum -- whose lives are depicted in The Pacific. *Hear intimate accounts of their personalities and experiences. *Meet their surviving families and, in some cases, hear from the soldiers themselves. *Making The Pacific (Disc 6, HD, 23 minutes): A solemn look behind the scenes in which key members of the cast and crew (among them Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg) discuss the history of the war in the Pacific, the soldiers involved, the battles that were recreated, the miniseries' production, its storylines and characters, the differences between The Pacific and Band of Brothers, the performances and the challenges faced along the way by everyone involved. *Anatomy of the Pacific War (Disc 6, HD, 10 minutes): Dig into the history behind the series with this exceptional, albeit far too short dissection of the conflicts and cultures that led to the war in the Pacific."

To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroesa washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.","Mary Parent; Callum Greene","10/15/2013","2013","","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\PacificRim201339983_d.jpg","883929328666","","0","Guillermo Navarro","Warner Brothers","4-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-Ray, DVD & Digital Copy","0",""

Directed by Geoff Murphy, it stars Steven Seagal as the ex-Navy SEAL, Casey Ryback and is the sequel to the 1992 film Under Siege also starring Seagal. The film was produced by Seagal along with Arnon Milchan and Steve Perry. The film's cast was made up of cameos and supporting roles by Everett McGill, Peter Greene, Kurtwood Smith and a then-unknown Katherine Heigl along with Nick Mancuso, Andy Romano, and Dale Dye, who were the only other cast members besides Seagal to reprise their roles from the first film. The sequel revolves around Casey Ryback who hops on a Colorado to LA train to start a vacation with his niece. Early into the trip, terrorists board the train and use it as a mobile HQ to hijack a top secret destructive US satellite. While not trained how to deal with a teenager, he soon encounters a situation he is trained for.","Arnon Milchan; Steven Seagal","8/15/2000","2000","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\UnderSiege2DarkTerritory28526_b.jpg","C:\Users\zerom_000\Documents\Movie Collector\Images\UnderSiege2DarkTerritory28526_d.jpg","085391366522","","0","Robbie Greenberg","Warner Bros.","Widescreen/Full Screen","0","Production Notes Theatrical Trailers Color Closed-captioned Dolby Widescreen"
